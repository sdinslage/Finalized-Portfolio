            and some I am still working on. I plan on updating this page as I work on and create more things in the future.

         <p class="project-details">This project was one I was very passionate about. I've always been big into 
            video games and this was my first real experience working with Unity and creating a game of my own. It is a 
            basic baseball game similar to that of Wii Sports baseball, but played in VR. This so far has been my favorite
            project to work on and I have plans in the future to attempt to create bigger and better games.

         <p class="project-details">This was another smaller project I made with the help of a couple classmates as a 
            class project for our CS 476 Blockchain class. The idea for this game was to create a blockchain based strategy
             game that has similar gameplay to that of Planet Zoo and DecentraLand. We created both a website showcasing our visison 
             for the game as well as a small Unity project that portrayed some of how the game would play. We were given a very tight 
             timeframe for this, only 3 weeks for both the website and the Unity Project, but I am pretty happy with how both applicatoins
             ended up.

            <p class="project-details">This is another project that I worked on in a group. For this project, I was responsible
               for creating a colorblind test that users could take to see if they had any type of color blindness. I created the entirety of the 
               test itself, with the homepage being created by my two groupmates. I created the images for the test via 
               <a href="https://imagetocircle.pythonanywhere.com/" class="inline-link">this website</a>.
               I wrote scripts for the test that as well. The main script counts the amount of errors the user 
               makes. If the user gets 3 questions wrong that are labeled as red-green, the results page will say they might have red-green 
               color blindness, and vice versa with yellow-blue. If there are a total of 6 or more errors, the test results will say the user 
               may have monochromia, or can only see black and white. There are also 2 control questions that are in black and white. 
               If the user gets either one of those wrong, the test will declare the user may have been randomly guessing as black and white 
               should be visible to all. This was a fun project to work on, I myself am not color blind but I know people who are and it was fun 
               creating a test and having them try it to see if my test was accurate.
